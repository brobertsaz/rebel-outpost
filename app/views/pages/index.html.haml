    What is the difference between a website and a web application?  A website displays information in the form of text, images, video, etc. for the visitor to view.  A web application is like a website but allows the visitor to do things like login, buy something, check email (Google Gmail) and is a lot more complex.

    From the very beginning of the development process we work with our customers to identify their needs and quickly get a rough framework of the application to them. By iterating off of this, customers get the exact end result they want, in the most efficient manner. For more information on how we do Agile, check out
